            <p class="about__cardText">Mane Attraction was initiated by Jeroen Schaafsma, a Dutch singer/songwriter and guitarist, after the splitting up of his band Fatally Flawed in 1997. With Fatally Flawed, Jeroen  recorded a single CD in 1996 called ‘First train to paradise’. Recorded in Amsterdam with Holger Schwedt and Frank Pels. It had some local airplay in Holland and received several very positive reviews in Dutch music magazines. Mane Attraction started recording their first EP in 2003 and was released in October 2006. This was the first time other musicians were involved during recording. After some shows between 2006 and 2010 it was time to start writing new material and first recordings started in 2012. All new songs are recorded in Jeroen’s PMM Studio’s in Holland. Some great musicians were invited to join Mane Attraction into the recording process. Recording of these particular parts took place in Nashville TN. and Lubbock, Texas. This time we went to Nashville again with the talented Emily Rose Nelson playing cello parts. The core of Mane Attraction still include Rob van der Hurk and Theo Dekker. Sadly on March 23, 2014 drummer Antoine Groen passed away.  Over the last couple of years the style of music has slightly changed, from Rock more to Singer/songwriter, Country influenced music as well as Folk and Americana.</p>
