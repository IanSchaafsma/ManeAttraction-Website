                    <p class="members__memberDescription">Started playing guitar at the age of 12. Influenced by early Country music and Dutch folk groups. Taking guitar lessons from Guus Bos back in 1984 for about 5 years. Got into songwriting when I was around 16 and soon started a local rock band called Fatally flawed. For this band I was the main songwriter. I’ve played mainly leadguitar for several bands and started Mane Attraction around 2000. After 2012  I went back more to my roots and writing songs as a singer/songwriter for my project: Mane Attraction</p>

                    <p class="members__memberDescription">Evan grew up in Ft. Smith, AR and is the son of a preacher. He started playing drums at age 2 and got his first drum set at age 8. It was through hours of watching other drummers play in church that he learned how to play for a song and try to convey a sense of emotion through the drums. After high school, Evan moved to Nashville to attend Middle Tennessee State University and studied with Lalo Davila and Tom Giampietro. Since leaving school in 2009, Evan has been touring extensively throughout the USA and abroad with various artists including Katie Herzig, Sugar and the Hi-Lows, Griffin House, Andy Gibson, Erin McCarley, and others. Evan is currently an in-demand session drummer in Nashville and has worked in the studio with Nathan Chapman (Taylor Swift), Jamie Kenney (Erin McCarley, Marc Broussard), Neilson Hubbard (Kim Richey), and many others. You can see him playing around Nashville with his band Escondido.</p>

                    <p class="members__memberDescription">Judy Rodman is an award winning vocal coach, recording artist, stage and television performer, public speaker, author, multi-genre hit songwriter, studio producer and vocal consultant. Singer/songwriter Judy Rodman was born the daughter of an air-traffic controller and part-time bluegrass musician in Riverside, California.  Judy began singing at age four and was a competent guitar player at age eight, when she debuted with her father’s band at a cruise ship party. During her family’s many moves, Judy developed an interest in different forms of music ranging from classical to Cajun to calypso. At age 17, she began singing commercial jingles; her voice was heard nationally on one for Jeno’s Pizza. She later studied music in college, where she and her roommate Janie Fricke became jingle singers at the Tanner Agency in Memphis; she also sang with Phase II, a local nightclub band. Judy worked as a backup singer during the mid-’70s for country and soul performers. After marrying professional bass fisherman and drummer John Rodman, in 1980, the couple moved to Nashville, where she began singing jingles for national companies. She also sang backup for some of Nashville’s biggest stars, including  Johnny Cash, Tammy Wynette and Ray Charles. In the mid-’80s, she had a Top 40 hit with her debut single “I’ve Been Had by Love Before.” Her second single, “You’re Gonna Miss Me When I’m Gone,” did better, and by the end of the year she had a Top 30 hit with the self-penned “I Sure Need Your Lovin’.” In 1986, Judy debuted on the  Grand Ole Opry and recorded her debut album “Judy”, which produced a number one hit in “Until I Met You” and the Top Ten follow-up “That She’ll Marry.” Her 1987 second album,”A Place Called Love”, featured several hits; singles from her upcoming third album were also successful, but her label folded before it came out. She then went back to singing backup and writing songs. In the mid-’90s, Judy wrote for Warner-Chappell Music.</p>
